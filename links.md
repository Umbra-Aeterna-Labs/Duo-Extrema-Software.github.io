### Project Gorgon Survey Helper

#### [Website](http://www.defenestration.co/pg/surveying/)

A surveying assistant.
It allows plotting of checked surveys onto a web page map where
they can be more easily manipulated. The app saves the position
of each survey so once you are done checking you have a clear
route without any painful micro-sorting.
