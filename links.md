## [Project Gorgon Survey Helper](http://www.defenestration.co/pg/surveying/)

<p class="right">Author: 'Clip'</p>

<p>A surveying assistant.
It allows plotting of checked surveys onto a web page map where
they can be more easily manipulated. The app saves the position
of each survey so once you are done checking you have a clear
route without any painful micro-sorting.</p>
