### Current Projects

Development includes 
[Phase Pharmer](https://github.com/duo-extrema-software/PhasePharmer), 
a web application used to aggregate game info about mushroom farming, 
calculate the current and next moon phase, and maintain timers for 
current mushroom farming boxes a player might have.
